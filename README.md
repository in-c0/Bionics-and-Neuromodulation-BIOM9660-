# Bionics-and-Neuromodulation-BIOM9660-
My notes while studying BIOM9660 at UNSW during T2 2025


Just logging a reflection about my passion in this area
```03/06/2025
I remember, by the time i was graduating with a game design degree in 2019/2020, i had some experience using some cutting edge VR/AR devices and having some startup owners visit us to give a talk.  i was very disappointed because things were much more behind and moving at a slower pace than i had originally expected. When i first chose to study design over programming in my first year of uni, my projection of the future was that, something like AI coding assistant would arrive sooner, that by the time i had graduated, i would no longer have to know how to program - that i would rather benefit more from having skills in design. The reality was different, but I still kept on believing that what I envision is possible and that I could take a role in it. Even when I was still working in the startup as a developer in 2022, I would often talk about my end goal being making a VR that is indistinguishable from reality and perhaps living in it forever. Then with covid, and hiring freeze, I saw the IT/tech world drastically slowing down and my new (and last) manager criticizing my dream as "being delusional" / "escaping from reality" / "having a family member to distract me will help" ...  and I took those words deeply and that's sort of when i had given up on my dream in VR. But that's also when AI started taking off with ChatGPT.
 In the past 5 years really (which to me feels like a decade away) we kept on advancing the tech gradually by taking small steps, over months, and years, that i almost forget to notice how much closer we've got to the future that i had indeed envisioned. That feels like "once upon a time". And I also stand in a slightly different ground about VR - it's no longer about denial of death. I think I would now accept it and welcome it. it's now more about easing the suffering of humanity while alive. giving back the quality of life. 
It would require two things:
- humans sensing (or interacting with) the world in a virtual space
- replicating the virtual space as closely as possible

i've been tracking only the latter part so far (which falls under CS) but the former part is what bionics does, so i think that's why I am so intrigued by bionics.

 I know my purpose is to 'ease the suffering of humanity' - that I realized a couple of years ago and I feel it will stay the same no matter what. I am still figuring out how exactly to be aligned with that purpose, or what my truest self-expression might look like. But I think I will always be driven in this direction - and even seemingly disconnected dots on my pathway will probably fall under this alignment when zoomed out.
